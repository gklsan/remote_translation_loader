# Remote Translation Loader [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/remote_translation_loader.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/remote_translation_loader)

`remote_translation_loader` is a Ruby gem for fetching YAML translation files from remote sources and dynamically loading them into your Ruby on Rails applicationâ€™s I18n translations. This gem is useful for applications that need to integrate external translations without writing them to local files.

## Features

- Fetch translation files from remote URLs
- Merge remote translations with local translations
- Directly load translations into Rails I18n without writing to files
- Handles YAML parsing errors and HTTP request failures

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'remote_translation_loader'
```

Then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install remote_translation_loader
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Initialize the Loader**

   Create an instance of the `RemoteTranslationLoader::Loader` class with a list of remote YAML URLs:

   ```ruby
   loader = RemoteTranslationLoader::Loader.new([
     'https://example.com/translations/en.yml',
     'https://example.com/translations/fr.yml'
   ])
   ```

2. **Fetch and Load Translations**

   Call the `fetch_and_load` method to fetch and load the translations:

   ```ruby
   loader.fetch_and_load
   ```

   This will:
    - Fetch the YAML files from the specified URLs
    - Parse the YAML content
    - Merge the remote translations with your existing local translations
    - Load the merged translations into Rails I18n

### Example

```ruby
require 'remote_translation_loader'

# Initialize the loader with remote YAML URLs
loader = RemoteTranslationLoader::Loader.new([
  'https://example.com/translations/en.yml',
  'https://example.com/translations/fr.yml'
])

# Fetch and load translations
loader.fetch_and_load

# Now you can use the loaded translations in your application
puts I18n.t('greetings.hello') # Output will depend on the remote translation files
```

### Handling Errors

The gem will raise errors in case of:
- **Invalid YAML Content**: If the remote YAML file is invalid, a `RuntimeError` will be raised with a message indicating a YAML parsing error.
- **HTTP Request Failures**: If fetching the remote YAML file fails, a `RuntimeError` will be raised with a message indicating the failure.

### Customizing Error Handling

You can customize the error handling by rescuing from `RuntimeError` or any other specific exceptions as needed:

```ruby
begin
  loader.fetch_and_load
rescue RuntimeError => e
  puts "An error occurred: #{e.message}"
end
```
